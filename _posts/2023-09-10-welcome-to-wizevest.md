Welcome to **WizeVest**. Our goal here is to help move you from learning to save well to learning to invest well for a rich and prosperous future. Saving is often about sacrifice and proper investing is often about delayed gratification. In the end, those two pain points are short-term difficulties that will lead to rich long-term rewards. Here at WizeVest we’re about teaching people to move from living in the moment to living for a better future. Investing all starts with learning how to save properly so that you’ll have free cash to invest.

## Great Investors Save Well

All of us here are excited to help you on your journey to becoming a skilled investor. Most of our guidance is about investing in the public equity and fixed income markets. That means picking quality stocks and bonds from publicly traded companies or participating in various interest-bearing vehicles to manage cash reserves. Having said that, our goal is to teach sound investment principles that can translate to other types of investments. If you’re a business owner you’ll also likely gain a tremendous amount from our resources. One of the primary goals of finding a good publicly traded company is knowing what qualities make a good company. Applying our analysis principles to your own business will help you to uncover problem areas or points in need of improvement. When you know where to look and what to do, change is easy. Before long, your profits may soar.

## Hard Work is Key

What will it take on your part to manage all I’ve promised? Work. Plain and simple. It’s going to take hours of your effort. At **WizeVest** we’re not about get-rich-quick schemes. Usually those only work for the first handful of people who get involved with them. The rest of us need to use our brains and our fortitude to push through the challenges we face. If you want to apply the principles we teach here, you’ll need to roll up your sleeves and get dirty. Don’t expect any article here to try to pick you up when you’re feeling bad because things aren’t going your way. What you’re going to get instead are words of encouragement, to find another book, put in more hours, partner with another investor, or any number of suggestions that cause you to work harder. Skill is only developed through the road of effort. You may start off doing well with what we teach, but at some point, you’ll hit a wall of challenge.

The only way to break through that wall is to work harder. Forget the idea of you being naturally talented. If you are, good, but don’t be lazy. Put in hard work and you’ll be a better investor than all of us mortals. Take it easy and skip the effort only if you’re ready to fade into the background of obscurity. I hope everyone reading this will be wize instead though, and learn the principles we teach, so you improve your lives and the lives of those you care about. We’re excited to take you on a journey of freedom through investing and wealth building, and we hope you’re ready to follow!

## Become a Truly Wize Investor
We’ll get into the details in order to move you from a speculative trader to a fundamentally driven true investor. When you learn to analyze investments with a long-term business mind, you’ll be able to take control of your nerves and manage the growth of your net worth in an intentional manner.

Investing is not about following the fads of the moment or about learning some secret knowledge at the right time. Those activities amount to speculation, betting on the unknown. With true investment wisdom you’ll learn how to break down the details of a potential investment and how to enter investments in a planned way.
